Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C). 
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is one with a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall. An example scenario include engineering projects that require detailed design, rigorous testing, and adherence to specifications.
Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
- Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
- Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): These are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g. Visual Studio(VS), Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
- Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g. Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Changing requirements
- Tight deadlines
- Technical debt
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing: This type tests individual components of a software.
- Integration testing: This type tests interactions between different components.
- System testing: This type involves testing the entire software as a whole.
- Acceptance testing:This type tests the software against the user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
  Their importance in software quality assurance is that they ensure that the best versions of the software are released.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of refining prompts/requests for generative AI services like ChatGPT to be clear and concise in order to get the best response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Translate this statement.
Improved prompt: Translate this this from Japanese to English.
The improved prompt is more effective ecause it is clear and concise, it clearly states the languages involved in the translation.
